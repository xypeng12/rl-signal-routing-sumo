# Joint Optimization of Traffic Signal Control and Vehicle Routing using MADRL

This repository contains the implementation of **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL)** for the **joint optimization of traffic signal control and vehicle routing** in signalized road networks.  


## Overview

- **Signal Agents (SAs)**: Control traffic signal timings at intersections.
- **Routing Agents (RAs)**: Assign vehicle routes dynamically.
- **Shared observations and rewards**: Encourage cooperation between SAs and RAs.
- **Algorithm**: Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic (MA2C) with custom deep neural network architectures.
- **Environment**: Modified Sioux Falls network in SUMO.
- **Objective**: Improve overall network performance compared to controlling signals or routes alone.
